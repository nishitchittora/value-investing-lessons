# Business - Great or Greusome

Buffett simplifies the problem for us. He says there are only three kinds of businesses – the great, the good, and the gruesome.

In his 2007 letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote …

*Charlie and I look for companies that have* 

*a) a business we understand;* 

*b) favorable long-term economics;* 

*c) able and trustworthy management, and* 

*d) a sensible price tag.* 

*We like to buy the whole business or if management is our partner, at least 80%.*

*When control-type purchases of quality aren’t available, though, we are also happy to simply buy small portions of great businesses by way of stock market purchases.*

*It’s better to have a part interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone*

## **A Great Business is an Economic Franchise**

Buffett terms a great business as an “economic franchise”, and believes that it arises in a business that sells a product or service that:

- Is needed or desired (continuous and rising demand)
- Is thought by its customers to have no close substitute (customer goodwill is much better than accounting goodwill, and allows the value of the product to the purchaser, rather than its production cost, to be the major determinant of selling price)
- Is not subject to price regulation (price maker)

Thus, the idea must be to look for companies that can survive and thrive at least over the next 20 years – businesses that have…

- Great brands;
- Operate in simple and growing industries;
- Clean balance sheets; and
- Managements with history of making rational capital allocation decisions (as seen from their high and/or industry leading ROE and ROCE)

Now, while “growth” rules the roost when investors are searching for businesses to invest in, stability – in industry, business economics, earnings, and growth – is more important than just growth.

# Understand Moat

Moat is such an important idea that it needs to be understood and appreciated by every value investor. 

Buffet says: *The key to investing is determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.*

## **Sources of Economic Moat**

For most companies having long term sustainable moats, one or more of the following characteristics exist –

- Strong brand power
- High switching costs
- Network effect
- Low cost of operations

# Analyzing Financial Statements

Three Financial Statements

1. Balance Sheet
2. Cash Flow Statement
3. Income Statement

## Balance Sheet

In simple terms, the balance sheet discloses what a business owns and what it owes at a specific point in time. It is thus also referred to as the statement of financial position.

The financial position of a business is described in terms of its assets, liabilities, and equity:

- **Assets (A)** are resources controlled by the company as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the company (like land, machines, plants, offices, brands, future receivables from customers, cash, investments etc.)
- **Liabilities (L)** represent obligations of a company arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of economic benefits from the company (like bank borrowings and future payment to suppliers of raw materials etc.)
- **Equity (E)** Commonly known as shareholders’ equity or owners’ equity, is determined by subtracting the liabilities from the assets of a company, giving rise to the accounting equation: A = L + E or A – L = E. Equity can be viewed as a residual or balancing amount, taking assets and liabilities into account.

### Liabilities

1. **Current Liabilities**: Liabilities for which payment is due normally in less than a year. This item includes things like Trade Payables (amounts a business owes its vendors), Other Current Liabilities (security deposits and advances from dealers, unclaimed liabilities etc.), Short Term Provisions (short term employee benefits, warranties on products, proposed dividend etc.), and Short Term borrowings (short term loans to mean working capital requirements).
2. **Non-Current Liabilities**: Non-Current Liabilities include Long-Term Liabilities (due more than one year into the future like a redemption of debentures), Deferred Tax Liabilities (arising due to difference in depreciation rates by Companies Act and Income Tax act), Long Term Provisions (employee benefits, etc.) and Long-term Borrowings (long term bank loans).

### Assets

1. **Non-Current Assets** are assets that are not easily convertible to cash or not expected to become cash within the next year. This item includes the following things –
    1.  **Fixed assets –** Tangible items like land, building, equipment, etc. Intangible items like goodwill, patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc. The third key item under Fixed Assets is Capital Work-in-Progress which are the assets that are in progress of being built.
    2. **Long-Term Investments –** Such investments can range from anything from buying a minority stake at another company to investing in equity shares and debt securities (for a period of more than one year).
    3. **Long-Term Loans & Advances –** Any loans and advance payments that the company has granted to employees, suppliers, and government, and which are to be received by the company in a period beyond one year.
2. **Current Assets** expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the business’s normal operating cycle, or within one year. This includes current investments (that a company makes for a short period of time), inventories and trade receivables, “cash and cash equivalents” (cash in a company’s bank accounts, plus highly liquid short-term investments), and short term loans and advances.

### Equity

Suppose a company was to issue 500 new shares in an IPO. The shares have a face value of Rs 5 and an IPO issue price of Rs 100. After the company issues these shares, here is how the addition is made into its Equity

1. **Share Capital**: Rs 5 of Face Value x 500 shares = Rs 2,500 will be added to its Share Capital
2. **Reserves and surplus:** Rs 95 of Share Premium (i.e., Rs 100 minus Rs 5) x 500 shares = Rs 47,500 will be added to its Reserves and Surplus**.** Plus Company profit after dividend paid

## Income Statement

The Income Statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time. It communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period (quarter or year) and what costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue.

### **Revenue from Operations**

This is the revenue or income a company earns from the operations of its core business. It includes Revenue from Sale of Products and Other Operating Revenue.

### **Other Income**

This includes interest income on bank deposits and other investments, and dividend income. When a company sells an investment during the year, any gain or loss from the sale of such an investment is also recorded in Other Income.

### **Expenses**

As the term suggests, it includes the money a company spends to operate its business. It includes the cost of the raw materials consumed, employee expenses, interest paid on the company’s borrowings, sales, and marketing expenses, and depreciation.

### **Profit before Tax**

his is the profit the company generates every year (or quarter) before paying income tax to the government.

### **Net Profit and EPS**

Net profit is the result of PBT minus Tax, and EPS can be calculated by dividing Net Profit by No. of shares outstanding.
